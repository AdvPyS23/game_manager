## Description

Gam3 man@ger is a little python tool to organise your social games. It also helps you find a good fit for your game event and gives suggestions for the next purchase.

The tool addresses all fans of board and card games and many more. It will especially help people that own a variety of games to keep an overview and make easier choices for any opportunity.

Users can personalise the program not only by creating their own collection of games but also by rating their experiences of playing them.
