## Description

Game manager is a little python tool to organise your social games. It also helps you find a good fit for your game event and gives suggestions for the next purchase.

The tool addresses all fans of board and card games and many more. It will especially help people that own a variety of games keep an overview and make easier choices for any opportunity.

Users can personalise the program not only by creating a library containing all your games, but also by rating your experience of playing them.
